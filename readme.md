# Many Worlds

![screens](https://github.com/brianfitzgerald/many-worlds/blob/master/screens.png)

Write or play adventures in this never-ending stream of stories written by players like you.

Use an in-app story builder to write adventures on the go, or browse ones made by others.

This is a personal project that I put together as an exercise in writing a creative tool for mobile devices, as well as an interest in making content authoring easier. I decided to go with basic, choose-your-own-adventure style stories, as a medium that users can interact with, that is also simple enough that it would be possible to make a mobile authoring interface for.
